              And thus ye have the inventors and the original of book-licensing
              ripped up and drawn as lineally as any pedigree. We have it not,
              that can be heard of, from any ancient state, or polity or church;
              nor by any statute left us by our ancestors elder or later; nor
              from the modern custom of any reformed city or church abroad, but
              from the most anti-christian council and the most tyrannous
              inquisition that ever inquired.

              Till then books were ever as freely admitted into the world as any
              other birth; the issue of the brain was no more stifled than the
              issue of the womb: no envious Juno sat cross-legged over the
              nativity of any man's intellectual offspring; but if it proved a
              monster, who denies, but that it was justly burnt, or sunk into
              the sea?
            </p>

              But that a book, in worse condition than a peccant soul, should be
              to stand before a jury ere it be born to the world, and undergo
              yet in darkness the judgment of Radamanth and his colleagues, ere
              it can pass the ferry backward into light, was never heard before,
              till that mysterious iniquity, provoked and troubled at the first
              entrance of Reformation, sought out new limbos and new hells
              wherein they might include our books also within the number of
              their damned. And this was the rare morsel so officiously snatched
              up, and so ill-favouredly imitated by our inquisiturient bishops,
              and the attendant minorites their chaplains. That ye like not now
              these most certain authors of this licensing order, and that all
              sinister intention was far distant from your thoughts, when ye
              were importuned the passing it, all men who know the integrity of

              They are not skilful considerers of human things, who imagine to
              remove sin by removing the matter of sin; for, besides that it is
              a huge heap increasing under the very act of diminishing, though
              some part of it may for a time be withdrawn from some persons, it
              cannot from all, in such a universal thing as books are; and when
              this is done, yet the sin remains entire. Though ye take from a
              covetous man all his treasure, he has yet one jewel left, ye
              cannot bereave him of his covetousness.

              Banish all objects of lust, shut up all youth into the severest

              them chaste, that came not hither so; such great care and wisdom
              is required to the right managing of this point. Suppose we could
              expel sin by this means; look how much we thus expel of sin, so
              much we expel of virtue: for the matter of them both is the same;
              remove that, and ye remove them both alike.

              dead, so to me it seems an undervaluing and vilifying of the whole

              Truth and understanding are not such wares as to be monopolized
              and traded in by tickets and statutes and standards. We must not
              think to make a staple commodity of all the knowledge in the land,
              to mark and licence it like our broadcloth and our woolpacks. What
              is it but a servitude like that imposed by the Philistines, not to
              be allowed the sharpening of our own axes and coulters, but we

              by an appointed officer, whose hand should be annexed to pass his
              credit for him that now he might be safely read; it could not be
              apprehended less than a disgraceful punishment. Whence to include
              the whole nation, and those that never yet thus offended, under
              such a diffident and suspectful prohibition, may plainly be
              understood what a disparagement it is. So much the more, whenas
              debtors and delinquents may walk abroad without a keeper, but
              unoffensive books must not stir forth without a visible jailer in

              proficiency which their flock reaps by them, than that after all

              Christian walking.

              This may have much reason to discourage the ministers when such a

              of their hearers, as that they are not thought fit to be turned
